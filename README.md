# Curious Cyber

## Overview

This project was originally developed as a school project several years ago. Over time, technologies and best practices have evolved, and the decision has been made to modernize and refactor the project using React.js and Vite.

The primary goal of this project is to:

1. Convert and refactor the existing codebase into a React.js application.
2. Utilize Vite as the build tool and development server for a faster and more efficient development experience.
3. Integrate a backend server in future iterations to enhance functionality and data management.

## Features

- **Component-based Architecture**: The project will be restructured into reusable React components for better maintainability and scalability.
- **State Management**: Leveraging React's useState and useEffect hooks for efficient state management and data flow within the application.
- **Modern Tooling with Vite**: Utilizing Vite for faster development, hot module replacement, and optimized build process.
- **Backend Integration**: Future plans include integrating a backend server to handle data storage, retrieval, and other server-side operations.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Vite
- (Future) Backend Framework (e.g., Express.js, Django, etc.)

## Getting Started

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
